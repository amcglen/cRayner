I need to take you right back to the beginning when my great, great Grandmother was alive in the 19th Century, as throughout these years each decendant has been born with a special gift, either one for destruction or one for healing but no matter what the gift it was always used for the good of the people.</p>
              
              <p class="intro-text">Each one of us hunted, our gifts to be used for power and devastation throughout the land, we fought back some ended up in hiding, there are still people who survived without going into hiding to this day!  I live in hiding, up in the Highlands of Scotland in a small stone cottage, with a stone built fire, a neighbouring burn for water, a vegetable garden and my children are good hunters for rabbit, deer and fish.</p>
              
              <p class="intro-text">The gift was known as Davana... here I introduce to you the whole story as it was back then, all those years ago...</p></div>

              <p class="intro-text book-overview-text">Cara Harwood is a seventeen year old senior, who lives with her brother Matt in Duluth Mn. Matt moved back to their family home and became her legal guardian after the sudden disappearance of their parents six months ago. Police believed that this was a simple case of abandonment but Cara and Matt knew differently, they were not your average family. Matt and their mother have special gifts known as Davana, it allows Matt to cause great harm with just the brush of his hand and in contrast their Mother can heal any surface wound. Their Father came from a natural bloodline and Cara believed she would never share in their gift, but all this was about to change.</p>
              <p class="intro-text book-overview-text">As with all opposites Davana had theirs, known as Vanators. They had hunted Davana until near extinction, preserving the gift for themselves. Matt and Cara believed this was the explanation for their parent’s disappearance.
                The new guy in school, Lucian Carter, intense, gentle and ruggedly striking. Cara is immediately drawn to him, as her life intensifies she has to deal with the everyday dramas of a teenage romance, the first kiss, passion and taking the next step, as well as coping with her unexpected and unpredictable Davana and learning the truth of its trigger. As their relationship deepens so does the heartache and tragedy that follows. Cara and those closest to her will struggle to survive the hunt.
                Cara has to fight to control her Davana and the unwanted twists she has to endure. Will his love for her keep her strong enough to survive?</p>
